# Binary Relay Challenge

## Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Binary Relay Challenge! This project is designed to introduce students to Computer Engineering concepts by building an LED breadboard using a Raspberry Pi 4. Through this challenge, students will learn about ASCII encoding and decoding, and compete to transmit messages the fastest and most accurately.

## Objective
-----------

The objective of the Binary Relay Challenge is for students to:

* Learn about ASCII encoding and decoding
* Build an LED breadboard using a Raspberry Pi 4
* Develop skills in transmitting data via binary protocol
* Compete against peers to see who can transmit messages the fastest and most accurately

## Requirements
-------------

### Hardware

* Raspberry Pi 4
* Breadboard with LEDs
* Jumper wires
* Power supply for Raspberry Pi (Micro-USB cable)
* Keyboard or other input device for encoding data

### Software

* Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian) installed on Raspberry Pi 4
* Python programming language (preferably version 3.x)

## Setup Instructions
------------------

1. **Set up Raspberry Pi 4**: Install the latest version of Raspbian OS on your Raspberry Pi 4.
2. **Connect Breadboard and LEDs**: Connect the breadboard to the Raspberry Pi 4, ensuring that all connections are secure.
3. **Install Visual Studio Code**: Install Visual Studio code to simplify the activity.

## Challenge Steps
------------------

1. **ASCII Encoding / Decoding**
 * Learn about ASCII encoding and decoding.
 * Use a Python program to encode and decode messages in ASCII format using LEDs.
3. **Transmitting Messages**
 * Use a Python program to transmit messages using LEDs between the Raspberry Pi 4 and your peers.

## Challenge Rules
-----------------

* Each student must work in teams of two students.
* Students are expected to share ideas and collaborate with peers during the challenge.
* The winning team will be determined by the fastest transmission speed and most accurate message decoding.

Have fun participating in the Binary Relay Challenge!
